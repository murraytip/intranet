# Publication and Acknowledgement Policies

Co-authorship on publications for staff members may be considered appropriate when they have provided one or more of the following:

- Significant intellectual contribution to the design of the published experiments;
- Substantial practical contribution to the generation, analysis and/or interpretation of experimental data;
- Indispensable technical support that contributed intellectually or scientifically to the advancement of the work.

Staff members who have made an intellectual or technical contribution not justifying authorship as defined above should be personally given an appropriate acknowledgement. When any data from our facility are used in your publication but no specific staff members have assisted in obtaining that data, please acknowledge the facility in general. This will enable us to demonstrate our involvement in the research of a large number of laboratories, aiding the procurement of future equipment and also Core Grant renewals.

Once your manuscript has been published...

- You must acquire a PMCID. Publications should be deposited into PMC (formerly PubMed Central) within three months of the official publication date.
- You must list the Core Grant (P30 CA008748) in the funding acknowledgements section of these published articles.
- You must associate the Core Grant (P30 CA 008748) with these publications in My NCBI.
