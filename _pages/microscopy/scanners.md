# Slide Scanners

Our Pannoramic slide scanners take your brightfield or fluorescent slides (normal as well as chamber slides) and completely digitize them. High resolution images are captured with 20x/0.8NA or 40x/0.95NA objective lenses, and the final image can be zoomed in to 40x and more without any loss of image clarity. Our confocal scanner will take images of single focal planes or multiple Z-stacks.
