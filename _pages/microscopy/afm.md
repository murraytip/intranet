# Atomic Force Microscopy

AFM is a powerful tool that enables imaging of structures beyond the optical limit.  AFM is unique in that a physical contact is made with the sample to generate an image.  A nanometer-sharp probe is used to gently trace the surface topography of the sample of interest, and hence, is capable of imaging under unique environmental conditions, such as under fluid or at extremes of temperature.  Furthermore, buffer solutions can be changed during an experiment in order to investigate changes that occur in a matter of minutes.  The AFM at MCCF is also conveniently mounted on an inverted optical fluorescence microscope, enabling colocalization of phenomenon via AFM-IF techniques.  Also, due to the physical interaction of the tip and sample, many physical properties of a material can be measured alongside the imaging regime.  Properties such as stiffness, charge, texture, and more can be interrogated via AFM.

Due to the vast array of experiments that can be conducted with AFM, we urge our users to sit down for a free consultation to determine whether we can fulfill their needs with our equipment.

## Configuration

### AFM
- Asylum Research MFP-3D-BIO on a Zeiss Axio Observer Inverted Optical Microscope
- Fluid handling system enables imaging in fluid, microfluidic systems in place to exchange buffer conditions during experiments
- Heated stage enables control of the environmental conditions
