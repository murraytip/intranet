# Optical Trapping with the Lumicks C-Trap

MCCF has now made its Lumicks C-Trap optical tweezers instrument available for use by the MSKCC research community. Using its four independently operatable optical traps, single biological molecules can be manipulated with extremely fine precision. 

The C-Trap can measure forces generated by biological systems with sub-piconewton accuracy, making it ideal for investigating interactions between single biological macromolecules: proteins and nucleic acids, protein folding, or intracellular transport. In parallel, a confocal setup with three laser lines allows simultaneous detection of fluorescent molecules, allowing events such as protein binding/unbinding to be visualized. A multiline microfluidics setup enables fast experimental buffers to be switched in real-time.

We encourage prospective users to contact us for a free consultation on how the C-Trap can help fulfil their experimental needs.

## Configuration

- Quadruple 1064 nm optical traps, independently operatable
- Five-lane temperature-controlled microfluidics apparatus
- Three confocal laser lines for fluorescence imaging: 488, 532 and 639 nm
