# Automated Histology at MCCF

## Our Purpose

The Molecular Cytology Core Facility uses new state-of-the-art machines that can process 100 slides a day to aid the molecular *in situ* detection of:

- cell proliferation
- stem cell potential and differentiation
- cell signaling
- cell death and senescence
- angiogenesis
- lymphangiogenesis
- hypoxia
- localization of mRNA and protein expression.

We can automate time-consuming and cumbersome manual experiments to provide high-quality, reproducible results. Our list of detection protocols is constantly expanding to meet the needs of our users.

Please see links to our [list of confirmed antibody markers](antibodymarkers) and [successful multiplex staining protocols](multiplexstaining). 

We are located in **Zuckerman Building 19th Floor, Rms 1938-1940, tel: 646-888-2564 (ex. 125-2564)**.
