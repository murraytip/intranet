# Automated Histology at MCCF

## Our Purpose

The Molecular Cytology Core Facility uses new state-of-the-art machines that can process 100 slides a day to aid the molecular *in situ* detection of:

- cell proliferation
- stem cell potential and differentiation
- cell signaling
- cell death and senescence
- angiogenesis
- lymphangiogenesis
- hypoxia
- localization of mRNA and protein expression.

By automating time-consuming and cumbersome manual experiments, we achieve high quality and reproducible results. We continue to expand our list of *in situ* detection protocols in synchrony with discovery of new molectular markers and with the needs of our users.

Please see links to our [list of confirmed antibody markers](antibodymarkers) and [successful multiplex staining protocols](multiplexstaining). We are located in **Zuckerman Building Rm 1930, 646-888-2564 (ex. 125-2564)**.
